# RSS Feed Reader FEND Project

## Project Overview

The following project is a working RSS feed that contains four different feeds each containing several links to relevant articles, websites, and references that populate when that feed is accessed via a navigation menu that toggles visibilty when the hamburger icon is clicked.  The feeds are populated using a Google API which has been provided in the [dependencies](#dependencies).  This functionality was completed prior to receiving the project and the main focus of this exercise was to create a series of Jasmine tests for the functionality of the application, which are located by the following relative path: ````./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js````
